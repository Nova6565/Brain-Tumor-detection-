Brain Tumor Detection with PyTorch and Gradio UI
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors using deep learning techniques, achieving an impressive 97% accuracy on the testing dataset. The solution is built using PyTorch and leverages a pretrained ResNet-18 model for efficient and accurate classification.

To enhance usability, the project includes a user-friendly Gradio-based web interface that allows users to upload an image and instantly receive predictions about the presence of a brain tumor.

Features
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes ResNet-18 pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for brain tumor classification.
High Accuracy: Achieved 96% classification accuracy on a structured testing dataset.
Gradio UI: Interactive and intuitive interface for real-time predictions.
Organized Dataset: Training and testing data are structured into folders by tumor type.
Dataset
The dataset is organized into subfolders based on tumor types for training and testing purposes, enabling efficient model training and evaluation.
